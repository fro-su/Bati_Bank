# Project Overview

## Business Context

As an Analytics Engineer at Bati Bank, a prominent financial service provider with over a decade of experience, you are tasked with a crucial project. Bati Bank is collaborating with a successful eCommerce company to launch a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) service, allowing customers to purchase products on credit, provided they meet certain eligibility criteria. Your role involves developing a Credit Scoring Model utilizing data from the eCommerce platform.

## Project Description

Credit scoring is the process of quantifying the creditworthiness of potential borrowers to estimate the likelihood of defaulting on a loan in the future. Traditionally, lenders create credit scoring models using statistical methods to analyze data from past borrowers in relation to their loan repayment performance. This model can then assess new loan applicants by comparing their information to the historical data used in model creation. The outcome is typically a score that indicates the applicant's creditworthiness or a prediction regarding their likelihood of default.# Overview
